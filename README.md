1. Scalable Microservices APIBuild a microservices-based API using Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes to demonstrate your knowledge of building scalable, distributed systems. Each service could handle a unique aspect of a larger application, such as user management, authentication, and data aggregation. Highlight your experience with inter-service communication, load balancing, and handling concurrent requests, as these skills are often in demand for backend developers.
2. Real-Time Analytics DashboardCreate a backend service that collects, processes, and displays real-time data (e.g., server logs, stock prices, or website analytics) on a dashboard. Use a websocket-based Golang server for real-time updates and leverage a lightweight frontend like React to display the data. This project showcases your expertise in Golang’s high concurrency and low latency, essential for real-time applications.
3. Task Automation SystemBuild an automation tool that schedules and performs routine backend tasks (e.g., data processing, file handling, API integration) on a schedule or based on events. Incorporate a RESTful API to configure tasks dynamically, and use Golang's concurrency features for efficient job handling. This kind of tool is especially useful for companies needing backend support for operations, making it a highly attractive project for Upwork clients.
Each of these projects would demonstrate your capabilities with Golang's concurrency model, microservices architecture, and real-time processing—key skills clients often look for in a senior backend developer.
